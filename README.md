# Dummy Model API Backend with Flask

This project demonstrates a simple Flask backend that serves as an API to interact with a dummy machine learning model. The main goal of this project is to create a backend application that can handle API requests, check the user requests in a database, and provide approved responses after the admin verifies the request.

## Project Overview

This project aims to create a backend system using **Flask** that integrates with a simple model. The flow is as follows:
1. **User Request**: The user sends an API request with their data.
2. **User Request Database**: The system checks the request against the **user request database**.
3. **Admin Approval**: The admin approves or denies the request.
4. **Model Interaction**: If approved, the backend communicates with the model and returns a response to the user.
5. **API Response**: The final output is sent to the user as an API response.

## Technologies Used
- **Flask**: Lightweight Python web framework used to build the backend API.
- **SQLAlchemy**: ORM used to interact with the database.
- **SQLite/MySQL/PostgreSQL** (depending on your setup): Database to store user requests and admin approval statuses.
- **Pandas/NumPy**: For handling any data manipulation if necessary.
- **Scikit-learn**: For creating the base model (dummy model).

## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up the project on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nikhiliitg/APIS.git
cd APIS

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For MacOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Set Up Database
```

Make sure you have your database set up, and configure the connection settings in your config.py file. You can use SQLite for simplicity or set up a MySQL/PostgreSQL database.

By default, the app will run on http://127.0.0.1:5000.

How It Works

User Request: A user sends a request to the backend API with data they want to process.
Request Verification: The system checks the request in the user request database to ensure the userâ€™s information is valid.
Admin Approval: An admin verifies whether the request should be approved or not.
Model Response: If the request is approved, the backend communicates with a base machine learning model (currently a dummy model), which processes the data and provides a response.
API Response: The response is sent back to the user through the API.
API Endpoints

1. POST /api/request
This endpoint allows users to submit requests for approval.
```bash
{
  "message": "Request submitted successfully. Awaiting admin approval."
}

```

2. GET /api/approve/<request_id>
This endpoint is used by the admin to approve or deny requests.

Request Parameters:

request_id: The ID of the user request to approve or deny.
```bash
{
  "message": "Request approved."
}

```
3. GET /api/model_output/<request_id>
Once the request is approved, this endpoint will return the response generated by the model.

Response:
```bash
{
  "model_output": "Some output from the dummy model"
}

```
